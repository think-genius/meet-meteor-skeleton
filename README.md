In this Meteor skeleton
----------------

Comes with a handy `/customize` route to edit scaffold (Bitter) styles and immediately see changes (Ã  la Meteor), then dispose of route when ready.

##### Packages included in this simple front-end workflow for meteor:

* [iron-router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router) - A reactive, highly customizable router that is Meteor specific -- it knows about your subscriptions, data sources and helps you take care of common problems.

* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - little language that compiles into JavaScript.

* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - A high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node.

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - The most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)  - Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) - A simple and lightweight mixin library for Sass.

* [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) - A lightweight semantic grid framework for Sass and Bourbon.

* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) - Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects.
